## Tips

1. **Batch organization IDs** — Send up to 10 org IDs per people search to reduce API calls
2. **Use `per_page: 25`** — Maximum efficient page size
3. **Filter by email status** — Use `"verified"` and `"likely to engage"` to reduce bounces
4. **Dedup by org ID** — Apollo can return same company across multiple searches

---

## Sequence Best Practices

1. **3-step sequences work best:** Day 0 (intro), Day 3 (follow-up), Day 7 (breakup)
2. **Name sequences clearly:** `CirrusLabs - {campaign-slug}` for easy tracking
3. **One sequence per campaign:** Don't mix campaigns into one sequence
4. **Monitor bounce rate:** > 5% = bad list, pause and clean
